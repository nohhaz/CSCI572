    "content": "Specific Course Information . | Course Description This course will introduce the theory of computation including computability and complexity. Topics will include Turing machines; decidable and undecidable problems, reducibility, recursive function theory, and time and space measures on computation. | Prerequisite . There is no prerequisite for this course, although taking CSCI 570 \"Advanced Algorithms\" is preferred. | . Course Goals . | Aims, Objectives, Program Outcomes | . This course aims to provide computer science students with a broad understanding of various models of computation, the relative power of the models, and the characterizations of the power of each model. They will be exposed to essential computational paradigms in a rigorous way. COVID-19 Statement . The wearing of a face mask in the classroom is mandatory. Students will be directed to leave the classroom if a face mask is not worn properly to cover the nose and mouth. Any student who refuses or fails to comply with the University’s requirements and precautions against COVID-19, and any other measures the University advances for the safety and protection of the Howard Community, will constitute a violation of the University’s Student Code of Conduct and could result in sanctions up to and including expulsion from the University. How will you be graded? . The assignments and exams all contribute significantly to your grade. Specifically, your final course grade will be calculated as follows: . Assignments: 20% Quizzes: 10% Participation and discussion: 10% Midterm exam: 20% Final Exam: 40% . A: 90-100, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, F: 0-59 . | Date | Content | Assignment | Due Date | Zoom meeting link | . | Week 1 | Chapter1-2 Introduction | 　 | 　 | Posted on BlackBoard | . | Week 2-4 | Ch. 3 The Church-Turing Thesis: Turing machines, variants of Turing machines, the definition of algorithm | Homework 1　 | 　Week 3 | 　 | . | Week 5-6 | Ch. 4 Decidability: decidable languages, the halting problem | Homework 2 | 　Week 4 | 　 | . | Week 6 | Midterm review | Project: write a short paper of 5-6 pages | Week 9 | 　 | . | Week 7 | Midterm Exam | 　 | 　 | 　 | . | Week 8 | Ch. 5 Reducibility | Homework 3 | Week 8 | 　 | . | Week 9 | Ch. 7 Time complexity | 　 | 　 | 　 | . | Week 10 | Ch. 8 Space complexity: Savitch’s theorem, the class PSPACE, PSPACE-completeness | Homework 4 | Week 11 | 　 | . | Week 11 | Final Review | 　 | 　 | 　 | . | Week 12 | Work review or presentations | 　 | 　 | 　 | . | Week 13 | Final Exam | 　 | 　 | 　 | . Policy on submission, late assignments, projects, and make-up exams . All assignments must be entered typed and printed or clearly handwritten. Regarding late submissions: a. No late submissions are accepted (even if the submission was wrong). b. Students may submit assignments late if an emergency occurs. The instructor must be notified of the emergency at least 12 hours before the deadline if possible. An approval from the instructor before the late submission must be obtained, and the submission must be done within a week from the deadline. In addition, a proof of the emergency must be provided. No make-up exams will be given unless there is a bona fide written doctor’s excuse. In the event that such an excuse is accepted, the deadline will be extended the number of days specified in the excuse. Regrading request must be sent within a week of the date the graded material was returned to the class. Requests for regrading or any questions regarding graded material will not be accepted after that time. Any graded material that is not picked up within two weeks after distribution will be discarded. No extra work requests are accepted. Grades will only be calculated based on the marking scheme. Academic Integrity Although discussions are encouraged, all homework and programming projects must be completed independently. Suspected plagiarism will incur interviews. The first verified plagiarism will result in zero point of the involved submission and cancel all extra credits. The second will result in a failure in the course. Statement on Sex and Gender-Based Discrimination, Harassment and Violence . Howard University’s Policy Prohibiting Sex and Gender-Based Discrimination, Sexual Misconduct and Retaliation (aka, the Title IX Policy) prohibits discrimination, harassment, and violence based on sex, gender, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or marital status. With the exception of certain employees designated as confidential, note that all Howard University employees – including all faculty members – are required to report any information they receive regarding known or suspected prohibited conduct under the Title IX Policy to the Title IX Office (TitleIX@howard.edu or 202-806-2550), regardless of how they learn of it. For confidential support and assistance, you may contact the Interpersonal Violence Prevention Program (202-836-1401) or the University Counseling Service (202-806-7540). To learn more about your rights, resources, and options for reporting and/or seeking confidential support services (including additional confidential resources, both on and off campus), visit titleix.howard.edu. Class Attendance Restricted to Registered Students . Only students whose names appear on the official course roster are permitted to attend class meetings. Students who are not registered are not permitted to attend or participate in course activities, do not have access to Blackboard, cannot submit course assignments, and will not receive a grade for this course. It is the students’ responsibility to ensure that they are properly registered by the published registration deadline. Requests to add courses after the deadline will not be considered. Attendance Policy . You are expected to and should attend classes regularly and complete all assignments on time. Class attendance may be a factor in determining the course grade. If you must miss a class, it’s a good idea to let your instructor know in advance or as soon thereafter as possible. If you don’t explain your absence, your instructor may assume you don’t care about the class or your grade. Coming to class late three times will be counted as one class absence. And later than 10 minutes will also be counted as one class absence. Students are required to attend class during the regularly scheduled tests and the final exam unless prior arrangements have been made. University ADA Policy . Howard University is committed to providing an educational environment that is accessible to all students. In accordance with this commitment, students in need of accommodations due to a disability should contact the Office of the Dean for Special Student Services for verification and determination of reasonable accommodations as soon as possible after admission to the University, or at the beginning of each academic semester. The Dean of the Office for Special Student Services, Dr. Barbara Williams, may be reached at 202.238.2420. ",
